# Unique Clock
Just for fun webpage implementation of Uniqlock, formerly available at http://www.uniqlo.jp/uniqlock/. It has been taken down as of 01/25/2017. Here is a video of what it looked like: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAMC1NizEU0

Changes from Turious:  

I am still a novice with Javascript and expect much of what I do to be inefficient or backwards.

Modified the implementation to use original source files and behave with a day/night feature as originally seen in the Uniqlock.
I will not provide the source files on Git, but any 5 second .webm's with 1 minute .mp3's will work in their place.
These files can be placed in a folder called video with subfolders for season1 through season6, per the original.

Still needs done: 
 • Hourly "interruptions" video and music like the original
 • Accurate hourly color changes to the original (I am failing to interpret the original ActionScript)
 • Starting the cycle timer on the :10 second marks instead of load clock
 • Less verbose console
 • Cleaner code
